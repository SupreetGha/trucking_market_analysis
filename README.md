### Project Overview
---

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the state of the trucking industry to assist my fatherâ€™s trucking business in making a key decision: whether to expand operations or maintain the current scale. This analysis aims to identify market trends, compare current industry metrics to historical downturns, and evaluate the trucking sector's performance in the broader economic context.

### Data Source(s)

Freight Analysis Framework: Sourced from the Department of Transportation via [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/freight-analysis-framework).

### Tools

  - SQL - Data Analysis
  - Python - Cleaning and Visualization
  - Excel - Organizing the Original Dataset

### Data Cleaning

Loaded Raw CSV into Python

```Python
import pandas as pd
# Path to CSV file
file_path = 'Transportation_Services_Index_and_Seasonally-Adjusted_Transportation_Data.csv'
# Read the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# Preview the first few rows
print(data.head())
```
Filtered for Relevant Columns
 
```python
# List of columns to keep
selected_columns = ['OBS_DATE', 'TRUCK_D11', 'TSI_Freight', 'TSI_Total', 'IND_PRO', 'MANUF', 'INV_TO_SALES']
# Filter the data
filtered_truck_data = data[selected_columns]
# Preview the filtered data
print(filtered_truck_data.head())
```
Saved file
```
# Save the filtered data to a new CSV
filtered_file_path = 'filtered_transportation_data.csv'
filtered_truck_data.to_csv(filtered_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Filtered data saved to {filtered_file_path}")
```
Formatted and Exported file
```
# Load the file (adjust delimiter if needed, e.g., ',' or '\t')
df = pd.read_csv("filtered_transportation_data.csv")
# Save the file with proper formatting
df.to_csv("cleaned_transportation_data.csv", index=False, sep=",")
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Key Areas

1. Correlation Analysis:
	- Assessed relationships between trucking activity, industrial production, and inventory-to-sales ratio.
	- Key correlations:
		- Truck Activity vs. Industrial Production
		- Truck Activity vs. Inventory-to-Sales Ratio

2. Rescaling and Trend Analysis:

	- Rescaled monthly data to identify seasonality trends in trucking activity post-2021 (post-COVID-19).

3. Historical Comparison:

	- Compared current averages of trucking activity and inventory ratios with historical economic downturns (2008, 2020).

Focus on metrics relevant to decision-making:

- Inventory-to-Sales Ratio: Highlights market health and demand fluctuations.
- Industrial Production: Indicates economic activity levels.
- Trucking Activity: Directly tied to your father's business.

### Findings 

#### Key Metrics Compared to Historical Downturns:

- Inventory ratios remain high, suggesting weaker demand and greater inventory in idle
- Figure [1.6](#1.6) demonstrates a high level of truck activity and a lower level of production meaning there is a greater supply of trucks compared to production 
- Trucking activity has not recovered to pre-COVID levels


### Recommendation

Given the current data:

	- Expanding operations is not recommended due to weak market demand and higher supply of trucks compared to production
	- Focus on optimizing costs and targeting high-demand periods in late Q4 and early Q4
 	- Wait for a decrease in truck activity and an increase in production

### Limitations

	- Economic Factors: The analysis does not account for external variables such as geopolitical events or elections.
	- Data Granularity: Industry-level data may not fully reflect regional construction trucking trends.
